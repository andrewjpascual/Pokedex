## About

This was my first project that involves a REST API and dynamically displaying the information into the website. With this simple but detailed project I was able to develop a better understanding for React and calling APIs for data. 

## Technologies

Project is created with:

-  ReactJS
-  Bootstrap
-  API/JSON (Pokeapi.co)
-  Axios
-  Styled components

## Features

- Search pokemons by name
- Fetch API from: https://pokeapi.co/ and display their JSON data in real time
- Click on the cards to see full detail of selected Pokémon :
  - Detailed card includes all types associated with pokemon
  - Colored stats
  - Biographical summaries
- Loading animations

## Challenges

There were two main difficulties during this project, the first being understanding how an API works and how to fetch data. After countless videos and tutorials I managed to grasp the idea of how they are called upon and used. Moreover, the second difficulty being how to implement some new functionalities. As this is my second react project and still being relatively new, I was experimenting with different CSS frameworks such as Material UI but then I transfered over to Bootstrap & Styled components as they were more documented and detailed, making it easier to implement specific features. Additionally, I struggled implementing the search functionality at first but as I read more about event handling and filtering in React, I found a way to implement search and this allowed me to develop the generation filtering as well.

## Inspiration

A large portion of this project was inspired by the ShinteiMai pokedex and wanting to learn about APIs in general. 

## To-Do

These would be my possible implementations in the future: 
  - Adding all pokemon :heavy_check_mark:
  - Filtering each pokemon based on generation / type :heavy_check_mark:
